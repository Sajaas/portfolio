  description: I've been working at Science Fiction Bokhandeln for several years, and am comfortable with every area in the shop. I always try to keep up with news and learn new things about the store, and know how to manage when people in charge are temporarily away. The highlights of working for the bookstore is the opportunity to recommend books and help customers as well as possible. Events and signings are not uncommon and are always fun to organise! During 2014 I organised the 30th anniversary celebration. It was during one week and consisting of more than 45 events and signings, including a ball at Nordiska museet and a parade through Stockholm. I also created a website with schedules and information about the week, and was the contact person regarding the celebrations for the two other stores in Sweden.
