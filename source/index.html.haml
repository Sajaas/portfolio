    %h4 Book-lover, organiser, gamer, traveller
    %p I've always loved building things, wether or not it's been wardrobes, stories or websites. Structuring and organising is also a weirdly passionate subject for me. This is why I'm looking for a future working with development.
    %p In my free time I love to spend time playing all kinds of games with friends (board-, role-, computer- and videogames) and reading.
    %p I wish I could say that travelling the world is part of my free time, but I don't get to do it as much as I want to. Still, traveling stays close to my heard and I always like to dream about (and secretly plan) my next trip.
